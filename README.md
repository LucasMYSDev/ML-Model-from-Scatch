# ML-Model-from-Scratch

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models implemented from scratch using Python. The models are created without relying on external libraries, showcasing the underlying principles and algorithms involved in each model.

The implementation of these models is inspired by [Assembly AI](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcWfeUsAys2k_xub3mHks85sBHZvg24Jd), a YouTube playlist that provides valuable insights into machine learning algorithms and their implementation.

## Instructions

To use the models in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Most of the models require the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries. Make sure you have both libraries installed before using the models. You can install them using the package manager of your choice (e.g., pip, conda).

2. **Model Usage:** Each model is contained within a separate file, making it easy to access and understand. Simply import the desired model file into your Python environment to access the model's functionalities.

3. **Explore and Experiment:** Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the models. Modify the code, tweak hyperparameters, and observe the results to gain a deeper understanding of how each model works.

4. **Further Customization:** As the models are implemented from scratch, you have the flexibility to modify and extend them according to your specific requirements. Dive into the code and adapt it to your use cases, or use it as a foundation to develop more advanced models.

By using these models, you can gain a solid understanding of the underlying algorithms and concepts in machine learning. Enjoy exploring and building upon these implementations to enhance your knowledge and skills in the field of machine learning!

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out. Happy learning!
